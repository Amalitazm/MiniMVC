About the author

I am not an experienced Python programmer so please forgive me if MiniMVC is not state of the art code. I started MiniMVC just for fun and to learn mod_python :-)

Feel free to contact me with your feedback about MiniMVC or if you want to contribute to make it better. I will mantain MiniMVC if there is some interest out there.
